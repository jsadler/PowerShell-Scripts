   Quick template to add a status bar to a PowerShell script
.DESCRIPTION
   To break down the sample, here is how to add the Write-Progress feature into a script:
   Create your collection: $comms = Get-Command
   Clear your counter: $I = 0
   Loop through the collection: ForEach ($comm in $comms) {
   Increment your counter: $I++
   Write your output as per usual: Write-Host $comm
   Write your progress bar (see below)
   End your loop: }
.EXAMPLE
   Example is shown below
#>

$comms = Get-ADComputer -Filter *

$i=0

ForEach ($comm in $comms) {

$i++

Write-Host $comm.Name

Write-Progress -activity “Searching...” -status “Status: ” -PercentComplete (($i / $comms.count)*100)

}
